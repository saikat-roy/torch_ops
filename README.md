# Torch Ops:
Random PyTorch ops that I happened to create over the years, sometimes with generous help from the PyTorch forums and Stackoverflow ofcourse.

Pretty useful until PyTorch adds official functions to its code base.

## Currently Implemented:

1. Patch Extraction from n-D tensors. `utils.transforms.extract_patches` can extract patches from arbitrary n-D tensors by specifying a filter shape and step.
